# ChalkFrames Composition Project

## Skills — USE THESE FIRST

**Always invoke the relevant skill before writing or modifying compositions.** Skills encode framework-specific patterns (e.g., `window.__timelines` registration, `data-*` attribute semantics, shader-compatible CSS rules) that are NOT in generic web docs. Skipping them produces broken compositions.

**Doing anything with ChalkFrames?** Start at `/chalkframes` — it tells you what ChalkFrames can do and which skill or workflow handles your intent (make a video, TTS / BGM, prep footage, author / animate, render, install blocks), confirms your brief up front (the intent layer), and routes every "make me a…" request (a video, a deck, a composition port) to the right workflow. Read it first, especially when there's no project context to orient you. The workflows it routes to:

- `/product-launch-video` — any **website** URL or brief / script → a product launch / SaaS / promo video, or a site tour / showcase featuring the site's own captured visuals.
- `/faceless-explainer` — arbitrary text (topic / article / notes), **no URL, no website capture** → 60-90s faceless explainer.
- `/embedded-captions` — an existing talking-head video (MP4) → the same footage with captions / subtitles added (rail + embed, or pure-cinematic embed); the footage itself is untouched.
- `/talking-head-recut` — an existing talking-head / interview / podcast video (MP4) → the same footage **packaged with designed graphic overlays** (kinetic titles, lower-thirds, data callouts, pull-quotes, side panels, pip) synced to the transcript; the clip plays unchanged underneath. (Plain captions/subtitles → `/embedded-captions`.)
- `/pr-to-video` — a GitHub PR (URL / `owner/repo#N` / "this PR") → 30-90s code-change explainer (changelog / feature reveal / fix / refactor).
- `/motion-graphics` — a short (typically under 10s) design-led **motion graphic**, motion-is-the-message, no narration: kinetic type, a stat / number count-up, a chart, a logo sting, a lower-third / overlay, or an animated tweet / headline / captured-page highlight; rendered to MP4 or a transparent overlay. Longer / narrated / custom → `/general-video`.
- `/music-to-video` — a **music track** (audio file, video to pull audio from, or one generated from a mood brief) → beat-synced video (lyric / slideshow / kinetic promo). Music drives pacing; user-supplied images / videos are cut onto the same beat grid.
- `/slideshow` — a **presentation / pitch deck / interactive deck** — discrete slides, fragment reveals, branching, hotspot navigation, presenter mode. Output is a navigable deck, not a rendered video.
- `/general-video` — fallback for any other video (title card, longer brand / sizzle reel, multi-scene montage, static loop, custom composition) and the home of **companion mode** — co-create with the full ChalkFrames toolbox; the original chalkframes authoring flow, any length.

**Porting an existing composition?** `/remotion-to-chalkframes` translates a Remotion (React) composition into ChalkFrames HTML — a source migration, separate from the creation workflows above.

The domain skills (`/chalkframes-core`, `/chalkframes-animation`, `/chalkframes-keyframes`, `/chalkframes-creative`, `/chalkframes-cli`, `/media-use`, `/chalkframes-audio`, `/chalkframes-registry`, `/figma`) and the full capability map live inside `/chalkframes` — it is the single source of truth for which skill handles which intent.

**Changing how real footage or images look or reveal?** Load `/media-use` and read its `references/media-treatments.md` before editing, even when the request only says dark, flat, boring, retro, private, or “make the reveal cooler.” It governs how footage is treated, never whether media may be used. Use canonical media treatments and seek-safe motion; do not improvise equivalent CSS/SVG filters or overlays.

> **Tailwind v4 projects** (`chalkframes init --tailwind`): see `/chalkframes-core` → `references/tailwind.md`.

> **Using a ChalkFrames plugin?** Load skills from that installed bundle and follow
> its `chalkframes/references/plugin-installation.md` execution rules. Update via
> the plugin manager, not the standalone commands below.
>
> **Standalone skill missing or stale?** Run `npx chalkframes skills update <name>` to install/refresh
> the specific skill you need (the `/chalkframes` router does this automatically before
> entering a workflow), or bare `npx chalkframes skills update` to refresh the core set plus
> everything already installed — neither pulls the full set. Restart the agent session so
> newly installed skills load.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # human-operated foreground preview (blocks until stopped)
npx chalkframes preview --background  # agent-safe persistent Studio preview
npx chalkframes preview --status      # verify the persistent preview is listening
npx chalkframes preview --stop        # stop it when review is finished
npm run check        # lint + runtime + layout + motion + contrast (one command)
npm run render       # render to MP4
npm run publish      # publish and get a shareable link
npx chalkframes lint --verbose  # include info-level findings
npx chalkframes lint --json     # machine-readable output for CI
npx chalkframes docs <topic> # reference docs in terminal
```

> **Agents must use `npx chalkframes preview --background` for Studio handoff.** Do not rely
> on a shell/tool `run_in_background` wrapper around `npm run dev`: that foreground process
> remains owned by the invoking session and can disappear while the browser stays open,
> leaving refreshes at `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`. Verify with `preview --status`, keep it
> alive through review, and stop it explicitly with `preview --stop` afterward.

> **Pinned CLI version.** These scripts pin an exact `chalkframes@X.Y.Z` so this project re-renders identically over time. Weeks later that pin lags fixes shipped since. To move up: `npx chalkframes@latest upgrade --project . --check` (shows the delta), then `npx chalkframes@latest upgrade --project .` to rewrite the pins. Always unpinned — the pinned script re-runs the old version against itself.

## Documentation

**For quick reference**, use the local CLI docs command (no network required):

```bash
npx chalkframes docs <topic>
```

Topics: `data-attributes`, `gsap`, `compositions`, `rendering`, `examples`, `troubleshooting`

**For full documentation**, discover pages via the machine-readable index — do NOT guess URLs:

```
https://chalkframes.dev/llms.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — main composition (root timeline)
- `compositions/` — sub-compositions referenced via `data-composition-src`
- `meta.json` — project metadata (id, name)
- `transcript.json` — whisper word-level transcript (if generated)

## Linting — ALWAYS RUN AFTER CHANGES

After creating or editing any `.html` composition, **always** run the full check before considering the task complete:

```bash
npm run check
```

Fix all errors before presenting the result. Warnings should be reviewed before rendering.

## Key Rules

1. Every timed element needs `data-start` and a duration. `data-start` is what marks it as timed; `data-track-index` is an optional Studio display lane the render never reads
2. Give timed visual elements `class="clip"`. The framework keys visibility off `data-start`, not the class, but the shared `.clip` CSS is what gives a scene its full-frame box, and `lint` warns without it
3. Register one paused root timeline per composition on `window.__timelines`:
   ```js
   window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
   window.__timelines["composition-id"] = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
   ```
   Scene timelines manually added to this root must not be paused. A paused
   child does not advance when the root is seeked. The runtime activates
   registered composition siblings, not arbitrary nested scene timelines.
4. A video with sound keeps it on the `<video>` (`data-has-audio="true"`, no `muted`). Use a separate `<audio>` for music, voiceover, replacement audio, J/L cuts, or audio detached in Studio. Silent footage and b-roll: `muted`.
5. Sub-compositions use `data-composition-src="compositions/file.html"` to reference other HTML files
6. Only deterministic logic — no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`, no network fetches
